Automatically create a bare-bone AWS EC2 cluster for yourself running ipyparallel.

This is really just a monolithic 'one-size-fit-no-one' automation script that came out of trying to understand how AWS EC2 and the [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/) work. Do yourself a favor and look at [StarCluster](http://star.mit.edu/cluster/) instead.
